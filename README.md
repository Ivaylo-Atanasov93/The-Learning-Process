# The-Learning-Process
Track my learning process

Since the first lockdown in 2020 I have decided to develop a new skill in a field that
I am interested in. I have chose Python as its widely used for many many purproses as
Web Developing, Scripting, ML etc.

Here you can see what I know and how I have learned it piece by piece.
I believe in this repository you can find more than 200 solutions
for the provided by SoftUni tasks from Basic to Advanced Python.

Python Basics
Programming Basics is the first course in the Software University. 
In this course I have learned the basic syntax in Python 
Programming Language. 

Python Fundamentals
The Fundamentals Module is the second part of the Python 
Course. From this module I have gained knowledge about Data 
types and Variables, Lists, Dictionaries, Functions, Classes and 
Objects, Text Processing and RegEx.

Python Advanced
In the next Python Advanced Module that I have taken I have 
covered Stacks and Queues, Tuples and Sets, Multidimensional 
Lists (Matrices), Comprehensions, Advanced Functions, File 
Handling, Error Handling and Modules.

Python OOP
In Python OOP I have learned how to define Classes, what is
Classes and Instances, Attributes and Methods, Encapsulation, 
Inheritance, Polymorphism and Magic Methods, SOLID, Iterators 
and Generators, Decorators, Testing and Design Patterns.

 Python Web Framework
I'm currently creating some Django projects to become used to 
the framework. Creating different apps and models, trying to keep
everything reusable. I'm finding it quite interesting and fun 
practicing CRUD operations, connecting the project with 
Database. I have started using PostgreSQL as it is most used 
with Django. There is obviously a lot more I can do with it and for 
me is very important to keep learning and developing new skills 
and to put them into practice.
